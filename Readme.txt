There are various files scattered around. If you are interested to start from the beginning, 
I would suggest to work with the following files:

1. netflix_sessions
2. netflix_titles
3. netflix_users

The goal is to combine all these three files into one db for your further analysis. I believe
in netflix_users.xlsx there is a data dictionary if you want to know more how I randomize the data.

Other files that might be of your interest is:
1. Initial Analysis - Titles.ipynb (some EDAs for me to explore more about netflix_titles.csv)
2. Converting Netflix Title.ipynb (My attempt to clean netflix_titles.csv)
3. Result.ipynb (actual analysis -- starting with some more EDAs, building models, performance comparison, 
and plotting)
4. TablesCombined.sql (if you want to practice your SQL practice, this is the three original csv files
converted into SQL tables)
4. Walking Documentation.txt (my record of everything that goes right and goes wrong in the project).
